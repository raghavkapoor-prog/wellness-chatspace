For beginners, I recommend starting with 2-3 strength sessions per week focusing on compound movements like squats, pushups, and rows, plus 2 cardio sessions of 20-30 minutes.

Focus on whole foods with adequate protein (around 0.8-1g per pound of body weight for active individuals), plenty of vegetables and fruits, whole grain carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Meal timing matters less than overall intake for most people, though post-workout nutrition can help with recovery. Remember that consistency is more important than perfection.";

If you struggle to meet protein needs, a quality protein supplement can help. For other supplements, creatine monohydrate is among the most well-researched for performance benefits. Vitamin D and omega-3s may also be beneficial depending on your diet and needs.";

Focus on sustainable lifestyle changes rather than extreme measures. Track progress through multiple metrics including measurements and photos, not just scale weight, as water fluctuations can mask fat loss.";

Focus on compound movements that work multiple muscle groups, and aim for 10-20 sets per muscle group per week. Muscles grow during recovery, so ensure you're getting adequate sleep and not training the same muscle groups on consecutive days.";

While I don't have specific information on that exact topic, I'd recommend focusing on evidence-based approaches that include balanced nutrition, regular exercise that you enjoy, adequate recovery, and consistency over time.
